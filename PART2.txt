Question 1: Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.

ANS : 
JavaScript is a vital scripting language for web development, executing on the client-side. It enables dynamic web pages, asynchronous operations, and is the foundation for popular frameworks. JavaScript ensures cross-browser compatibility, aids in form validation, manages data storage, and facilitates multimedia. In essence, it enhances user experiences and is a cornerstone of modern web development.

Question 2: Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where
you would use each.

ANS :
JavaScript:

- Adds interactivity and logic.
- Executed on the client-side.
- Used for programming and DOM manipulation.
- Requires `<script>` tags.
- Examples: Form validation, dynamic content, AJAX.

HTML:

- Defines structure and content.
- Static, interpreted by the browser.
- Used for content structuring.
- Consists of tags.
- Examples: Page layout, images, links.

Use Cases:

- JavaScript:
  - Dynamic content, interactivity.
  - Validating input, handling events.
  - Asynchronous requests.

- HTML:
  - Structuring content.
  - Page layout, images, links.
  - Defining semantic elements.


  Question 3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.

  ANS : 

  Primitive Data Types in JavaScript:

1. String:
   - Represents text.
   - Example: `"Hello, World!"`.

2. Number:
   - Represents numeric values.
   - Example: `42`, `3.14`.

3. Boolean:
   - Represents true or false values.
   - Example: `true`, `false`.

4. Undefined:
   - Represents an uninitialized variable.
   - Example: `let x;`.

5. Null:
   - Represents the absence of a value.
   - Example: `let y = null`.




Question 4: What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the
'let' keyword? 

ANS : 

**Purpose of Declaring Variables:**

- Storage, Manipulation, Reuse:** Variables store, manipulate, and allow reuse of data values in a program.

Declaring Variables with 'let':

```javascript
let variableName;
```

- Example:
  ```javascript
  let count;
  ```

- Purpose:
  - Declares a block-scoped variable.
  - Initialized with `undefined` until assigned a value.





Question 5: Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and
multi-line comments.

ANS : 


Importance of Comments in JavaScript:

Documentation: Comments provide explanations for code, aiding developers in understanding its purpose and functionality.
Debugging: Comments help locate and understand issues during debugging.
Communication: Facilitates collaboration by conveying information to other developers.



Question 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.
Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.

ANS : 

Importance of Meaningful Variable Names:

Readability: Clear identifiers enhance code readability, making it easier to understand and maintain.
Understanding: Descriptive names convey the purpose and usage of variables, aiding comprehension.
Collaboration: Facilitates collaboration among developers by promoting a shared understanding of the code.
